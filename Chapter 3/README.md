# Chapter 3: Bayesian inference for population attributable measures from under-identified models

Three examples where identified in this chapter which resulted in the underlying statistical model being considered under-identified. The case-control study, cohort study and cross-sectional study where measurement error associated with an imperfect diagnostic test on exposure is incorporated (but could have been considered on disease as well). This collection provides the code for only two of these examples: the case-control study and the measurement error example. Code for the cohort study has not being provided as it is simply analagous to the case-control study.
