# Bayesian methods of confidence interval construction for the population attributable risk from cross-sectional studies

This collection of code allows the user to implement the Frequentist delta, jackknife and bootstrap approaches for estimating the PAR and its confidence interval (DeltaCI.R, JackknifeCI.R and BootstrapCI.R). Additionally, we provide code for implementing a Bayesian alternative for estimating the PAR and its credible interval (BayesCI.R).

Each of these methods are compared through simulation and their performance discussed in [Pirikahu (2016)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.6870). The functions used in order to perform and analyse the simulation results is provided in Simulation_Functions.R and RunSimulations.R. In order for each of the code files mentioned to run the user must first source the Useful_Functions.R file.
